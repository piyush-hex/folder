    <h1>Chapter 8 – Information Security and Cyber Law</h1>
    <p>Information security is a critical aspect of protecting data and systems from unauthorized access, breaches, and cyber threats. It encompasses a range of practices, technologies, and policies designed to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data. With the rise of digital communication and online transactions, the need for robust security measures has become paramount. Cyber law, on the other hand, refers to the legal frameworks and regulations governing the use of the internet and digital technologies. It addresses issues such as data protection, intellectual property rights, cybercrime, and privacy concerns. Together, information security and cyber law play a vital role in creating a safe and secure digital environment, ensuring that individuals and organizations can operate confidently in the online world.

<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
<div class="card">
<p id="bold"> <strong> 1. What are some activities that are considedered as cyber crime?</strong> </p>
<p> <strong>Ans:</strong> Cybercrime ranges across a spectrum of activities. At one end are crimes that involve fundamental breaches of personal or corporate privacy, such as assaults on the integrity of information held in digital depositories and the use of illegally obtained digital information to harass, harm, or blackmail a firm or individual. These new cybercapabilities have caused intense debate. Pegasus spyware, for instance, according to its creator, the Israeli cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group, is sold exclusively to government security and law enforcement agencies and only for the purpose of aiding rescue operations and battling criminals, such as money launderers, sex- and drug-traffickers, and terrorists. Yet, the smartphone-attached spyware, which can steal private data without leaving an obvious trace of its activities, has been widely used covertly by governments to track politicians, government leaders, human rights activists, dissidents, and journalists. It was even used to track Saudi journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi months before his murder and dismemberment by Saudi agents in October 2018. Also at this end of the spectrum is the growing crime of identity theft.</p>
